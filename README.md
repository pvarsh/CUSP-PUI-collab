Test cases and helpful scripts:

* assignment-2           - peters python scripts for downloading+ checking assigment 3
* assignment-3           - peters python scripts for downloading + checking assigment 3
* assignment-3-with-make - brigittes makefile for downloading, checking and zipping. uses lots of UNIX stuff.

# Why test cases
This repository is primarily for test cases for Principle of Urban Informatics homework assignments.
The assignments are graded on multiple data sets, and there is no guarantee that if your code runs correctly
on sample data provided in the assignment, it will also run correctly on other data. Here we can share
test cases to help each other check and debug our code.

# What not to post
Please do not post your solution code until at least two days past the due date of the assignment.

# File name guidelines for test cases
I propose the following naming format. For test cases for problem 4 of assignment 3 submitted by Terry Gilliam:
- input files: test_case_hw3_pr4_tg1.txt
- output files: output_hw3_pr4_tg1.txt

# Directory structure
Please put your test cases into the assignment-# folder located in the root.

# Documentation
If you submit code (makefiles, shell scripts, other auxiliary code that is helpful to the assignments but does not give away the solution),
please include your name, a description of your code, and instructions on how to run it in the header of the file.
